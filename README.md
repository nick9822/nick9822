# 👋 Hi, I'm Nick (@nick9822)

I'm a software engineer passionate about performance, developer tools, and open source. Over the years, I've contributed to several prominent open-source projects in the Go, Rust, Flutter, and Python ecosystems. I'm especially focused on areas where performance, security, and developer experience intersect.
